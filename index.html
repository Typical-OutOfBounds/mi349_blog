            <h3>Remote Work</h3>
            <p>
                After a very stressful year, I'd love some time to relax and wind down but I've been
                back at work since the semester ended. This summer I'm interning again with the company 
                I worked at last summer, and again, almost everyone on my team is remote. Don't get me 
                wrong, I love working from home, but for me personally it can definitely have some 
                downsides. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The only place for me to work in my house is my room, and as someone who finds it hard 
                to focus, I'm constantly surrounded by distractions. Without an office atmosphere to
                promote work through your peers and environment, it can take a while to get acclimated
                to working. I didn't have as much of an issue with this last year, but maybe that's 
                because I'm no longer as eager to prove to my team that I can program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I still love being able to work from home, but I think I might start coming in two or
                three days a week to get into the swing of things again. Especially now that my mentor
                is working at the office for the next few weeks, this would probably be the best idea
                to get out of this slump. In the past, pomodoro timers have really helped me study, so 
                I'm also going to start inlcuding those during my working hours. Even with my personal
                problems with remote work, I still love it and would hate having to go the office
                everday.

            <h3>STARS WARS Squadrons</h3>
            <img src="squadrons.jpg" alt="Star Wars squadrons promotional image" width="350" height="200">
            <p>
                After a year of questioning whether or not to buy STAR WARS Squadrons, I finally pulled
                the trigger. I'm still in the campaign stage and haven't had a chance to try out any
                multiplayer and get pummeled by all the flight sim hobbiests, but so far I'm really 
                enjoying my experience. The game feels like I'm living a childhood dream. You get to
                realistically fly first person in a tie fighter and shoot down those blasted rebels.
            </p>
            <blockquote>Did you hear that? You get to fly first person in a tie fighter!</blockquote>
            <p>
                The flying isn't anything like the flying mechanics in STAR WARS Battlefront II, they're
                more invloved and quite a bit more difficult. It takes a little adjusting to move around
                how you want to and follow enemies in the dogfights. Even though I'm pretty bad, I'm
                still enjoying the learning experience the feeling of being an x-wing or tie fighter pilot.
                Who knows, this might enourage me to buy a simple flight stick and throttle, which could 
                be a lot of fun. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There are lot of games on my plate that I have yet to play or should be putting more time
                in, but I expect to be playing this for a bit. I hope I get a little better before playing
                any multiplayer, because I know that I'm going to get smoked in my first match.
